# Neural-Network Quantum State Tomography

Explores the use of neural networks to improve sample efficiency during quantum state tomography.

This project is part of my Master's Thesis at the Johannes Kepler University Linz. It aims to replicate and extend on
the results of the paper
["Neural-network quantum state tomography for many-body systems" by Torlai et al. (2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.05334).
